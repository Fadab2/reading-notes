## What Google Learned About Teams
The company studied hundreds of teams so that to figure out why some teams stumble while others soar. They were trying to figure out what criteria the successful teams have in common that influenced their success. They studied whether these people have

Have similar interest
Have same level of motivation
How often they socialize outside of work
Did they have same hobbies?
Did they similar study background?
The researchers did not find any specific pattern that contributed to team success. The researchers then switched to studying group norms looked into other factors such psychological factors. They concluded that psychological safety contributed to team success and provided a different approach to find out why some teams succeed while others failed. Not been punished or rejected for speaking up, mutual respect and trust, and giving every member an opportunity to talk and contribute are some of psychological safety examples. In addition to that things like clear goals and creating culture of the dependability were important as well.
