## 

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
## SQL
  - Is  Relational Databases
  - table based databases, represent data in form of tables
  - have predefined schema
  - vertically scalable 
  - uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data

## NoSQL
  -  Is non-relational
  -  document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
  - databases have dynamic schema 
  - horizontally scalable
  -  database, queries are focused on collection of documents
 
 	 
1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
   -  are good fit for the complex query intensive environment
2. Give a real world example.
   - queries and joining data across tables
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
   -  large data set 
4. Give a real world example.
   - Hbase and read/write request.
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
   - NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
   - MySQL


## SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB
1. What does SQL stand for?
   - Structured Query Language
2. What is a realational database?
   - Data that works with certain assumptions or in a certain way and supports the structured query language.
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
   - 
4. What is a ‘schema’?
   - the structure of the database
5. What is a NoSQL database?
   - irrational non-table based database
6. How does it work?
   - Instead of tables we have collection and ducoments
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?
   - documents.
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
   - MongoDB is more flexible. Because you can have like empty values
9.  What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    - schema-less can be disadvatage because you have no schema to inforce some relation.
