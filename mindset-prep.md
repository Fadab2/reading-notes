## Prep Your Mindset

### Delibrate Practic
- Building software everyday doesn't mean you a better programmer everyday.
- You can improve your technical skills to build better software.
- Deliberate practice means you concentrate and repeat difficult and challenges parts to improve individuals performance.
- know your weaknesses and challenges and have a goal to improve.

## Growth Mindset
- A growth mindset accepts challenges and sees it as an opportunity to develop and grow.
- The fixed mindset rejects challenges and sees it as an obstacle.
- A fixed mindset can be transformed into a growth mindset by regularly pushing it outside the comfort zone and learning something difficult.

## Grit

- Everyone can learn the material if they work and long enough.
- Grit and not IQ decides who will be successful. 
- You have to have persistence and long term goals to succeed.

## Redefining Success

- One of the reasons we might be suffering of career crises and anxiety is we are surrounded by snobs.
- A job snobbery is someone who takes a small fact about you "say what you do" and comes to a complete conlcucsion of who you're.
- Let's not judge people on what they do, but who they actually are.
- Always feel sympathy rather than contempt.
- Anyone can work hard to achieve what they want to be. 
- Anyone with talent, skills and energy can get to the top.
- There is difference between an unfortunate and a loser.
- You can have success, but you can't be successful in everything.
