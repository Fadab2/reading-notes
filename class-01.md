# Website Component
The main component of website is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
HTML is the main component that we see like text, images, and videos.
CSS is used to nicely place component of the site in an ordered nice layout and give it colors, sizes and anomations.
JavaScript comes in to give the websites their functionality such as the behavior of a button when clicked, what to do with data entered by the user and retrieve data from the server and store in the server etc.
Web browsers are specialized in reading HTML files and applying all the settings provided by the CSS/JavaScript.

## HTML

HTML is composed of elements and the elements have tags.

Some examples of HTML tags are:
from top we start with the document type by telling the browser this is an HTML file `<!DOCTYPE html>`
our files also includes `<html> </html>` this is one of the tags that must have opening and closing tags. Elemenst such as Meta data and title go between the opening and closing tag of `<head>` tag. Other tags with opening and closing tags are the `<body> </body>` everything inside the body is what we see when we visit a websit. Things like text/paragraphs, images, videos go between the openning and closing body tags. This includes tags `<h1>, <p>, <div>, <header>` Some tags do not have closing tags such as the `<b>` which makes a text bold.

## CSS

We use CSS to make the website look beautiful and utilize the space. We can resize images, change background, and give some animation to our website. We do this by using inline styling, enternal or external CSS. The different between these is where the styling happening, inside a tag, on top of file inside the header tag or expertnal file then linked to the HTML file, respectively. 

We use the `<style> </style>` tag to do all the styling between these tag. We can style by using tag name `h1 {
    background-color: red;
}` etc. Or use IDs or classes inside the HTML file then use these identifiers to style the site.

## JavaScript

As mentioned above JavaScript gives website their functionality. Browser interpret our script for the computer.

Some tasks we can acheive using JavaScript are display alert to the user using the `alert()`, prompt the user for input using `prompt()`, display output to a console using `console.log()`.
We store data in variables using the keyword `let` so we can easily manupilate data using variables.
