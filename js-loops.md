# Learning about Loops
Loops are used to do some action repeatedly or a certain number of time until some condition is achieved. There are different types of loops, but all do same tasks and a specific loop might be more suitable for specific task.
## for loop:
For loop repeats some task until some condition is false. The syntax for JavaScript for loop is
For (([initialization]); [some condition]; [increment condition]);
Statement
Etc;
For (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	Console.log(i);
}
Will print numbers 0-9 and stop when i is 10 because of the condition.

## While loop:
While loop is another version of loop. It executes until the condition is true.
Syntax:
While (condition)
Statement
Example:
Let i = 0;
Let sum = 0;
While (I < 10) {
i++;
sum += i;
