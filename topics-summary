Github is a tool that programmers use to show their code, project/website to anyone through the Internet. It turns your pages into website. It is kind of hosts your code without you buying a domain name or any other services. It keeps track of updates of changes you make to your code. While your code is safe in the internet even if something happens to your computer you will still have access to your Github pages. It also makes it possible for a group of people to work together in a certain task with each doing part on the project.
Markdown is an easy way for coders to do things that usually done using Microsoft Word or HTML. Using markdown we can easily format texts like making it bold, italic, newline, larger/smaller, lists etc like we can proceed a line with # to make it a header (larger text), the more # we add the smaller the text becomes up to a maximum of 6 “#s”
In addition, Github users can use many shortcuts to speed up processes and communication such as using @ before a uername which makes that specific user getting notified like when we tag a person in Facebook etc.
