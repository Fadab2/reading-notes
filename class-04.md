## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

### HTML Links
- Creating links to other sites/pages/emails we uses
   `<a href="url">what shows on the page</a>` tag. Anything inside the url is clickable and takes us to that address.
  
### CSS Layout

CSS layout is used to 
- controlling the position of elements
- Creating site layouts
- Designing for different screen sizes

Block level elements such as `<h1`> and `<div>` start on a new line.

Inline level elements such as `<ima> and `<b>` start wherever they find space

## JavaScript Functions
### Declaring functions
We create a function by starting with the function keyword followed by the function name, parameters if any and whatever the function will perform is put inside the curly braces.

example:
` function myFunction() {
    some commands/text
}`

Functions must be called to be used. We call the a function using its name and supplying any parameters if any. For example we can call the above function using its name and curly braces `myFunction();`
