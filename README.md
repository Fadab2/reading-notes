  ### Growth mindset means
  
 Growth mindset means to believe that you can achieve better level of mental abilities or skills set through practice. And believe that you can learn anything if you put enough  effort and be persistent in learning something or achieving something no matter how hard it is.  You just have to keep going and you mind and abilities will grow and things that were hard once in the past they will become easier.
  
Whenever we feel something is above our abilities and we cannot do it we have to go back and read and read and do research to see if we can have a better understanding from a different point of view. For me, it really helps me to read different sources from different people because not everyone explanation or approach fits my understanding. At the same time I try to get a smaller part of a problem done instead of getting lost in the big final product/picture.
