# Bio
Hello. I am Edris, I have a B.S in IT, but did not work in the field since I graduated 10 years ago. I am back to learning to code as I have passion for building things using computer. I decide web development suits me better because I can instantly see what I have built as I am more vistual learner.
My interest include soccer, table tennis, music, travel cooking and baking.

My goal is to graduate from Code Fellows and find a job in tech as a web developer.

### ***Growth mindset means***
  
 Growth mindset means to believe that you can achieve better level of mental abilities or skills set through practice. And believe that you can learn anything if you put enough  effort and be persistent in learning something or achieving something no matter how hard it is.  You just have to keep going and you mind and abilities will grow and things that were hard once in the past they will become easier.
  
Whenever we feel something is above our abilities and we cannot do it we have to go back and read and read and do research to see if we can have a better understanding from a different point of view. For me, it really helps me to read different sources from different people because not everyone explanation or approach fits my understanding. At the same time I try to get a smaller part of a problem done instead of getting lost in the big final product/picture.

**How to keep myself in a growth mindset**:

1.	I found the “instant gratification monkey syndrome” quiet fitting to me when I am faced with the first obstacle on doing something. And reading this article helped me a lot      recognizing I suffer from it. So whenever I catch myself falling into the “instant gratification monkey syndrome.” I will remind myself the problem won’t get solved and I won’t     achieve any progress by avoiding the task.
2.	I will remind myself that every time I postpone something out of laziness or difficulty I will always come back and regret it.
3.	The only way to progress in life, in career or any skills is to go working hard even when it sound impossible a little by little I can make progress
