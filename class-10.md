## Debugging

Degugging is finding and eliminating the causes of code errors.

  ### Some types of errors

-  SyntaxError
    - Mistyping a variable name etc
    - Unclosed quotes
    - Missing closing bracket
    - Missing comma in an array
- ReferenceError
    - Trying to use undeclared variable
- TypeError
    - Trying to use an object or a method that doesn't exist
- RangeError
    - Calling a function with a number outside its range.

 
- In order for us to find errors easily we have to understand how a program executes.
- The console helps us find errors by giving us an error message and a line number when the error is triggered.
- If we are expecting errors to happen on our code then we can use `try, catch, finally` statements.

### Dealing with errors:
- Whenever coming accross an error debug the code
- We can handle errors using `try, catch, throw, and finally`

### Debugging workflow
1. Understand the error message and get some information on where to look
2. Check how far the script is running by using console log.
3. Use breakpoint to inspect the values etc
