Reading 7 programming with JavaScript

# Expressions and Operators:
Some of the Types of JavaScript operators are:
-	Assignment operators: Assigns a value to its left operand. example : x = y assigns the value of y to x

-	Comparison operators: compares its operands and returns true or false. Example: var var1 = 5.

-	Arithmetic operators: takes numbers and returns a single number value. Example 10 / 5.

-	Bitwise Operators: it treats the operands as a set of 32 bits. Example: a & b (a AND b).

-	Bitwise logical operators: 

-	Bitwise shift operators:  takes two operands quantity to be shifted and amount to be shifted.  Example 10 << 4.

-	Logical operators: they are like Boolean return true or false example; A && B.

-	Short-circuit evaluation: doesn’t check the whole expression if one rule is broken already.

-	String operators: adds strings together. Example ‘a’ + ‘b’

-	Conditional operator: this one takes 3 operands example: condition? Val1 : val2

-	Comma operator: evaluates its operands and returns last value.

-	Unary operators: it only has one operand: example: delete something

-	Typeof returns the type of the evaluated expression.
# Functions
Functions are set of code that does a task or calculates a value and/or takes some input and returns some value. Functions must be defined before used.
To declare a function we start with the function keyword and then give the function a name, parameters and enclose it in curly brackets. Example:
Function square(number) {
	Return number * number;
}
