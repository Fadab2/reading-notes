## HTML Lists
  
## There are three types of lists:
* Ordered list
  *  In which items are order by numbers and we use `<ol>` tag and `<li>` used inside it to list the item
* Unordered list
  *  which uses bullets or list the item and we use the `<ul>` tag and `<li>` used inside it to list the item
  
* Definition lists
  *  which is used to list item with definitions. `<dl>` is used and inside it `<dt>` is used specify the term and the `<dd>` to define that term. 
## CSS Boxes

CSS treats items as if they were inside a box. We can give these boxes dimensions such as and width and height using the `<width>` and the `<height>` keyword.

for example to specify the container box of a `<p>` we can use
* p {
        width: 300px;
        height: 400px
   }

We can also give our elements things like:
* Border
* Margin
* Padding

## Basic JavaScript
  Variables:
* used to hold values
* declared before they can be used.
* Declared using the key words `var`, `let` and `const` followed by the variable name and then assigned a value. for exampe: let age = 40; stores the value 40 in the age variable.

## Loops:
* Used to check specific requirements/conditions and they only run if the conditions true.

There are 3 types of loops:
* for loop.
*  used if we know exactly how many times we want the loop to run.
* while loop
*  used when we don't know the exactly how many times we will run the loop.
* do while loop 
*   same as while loop except it will run once before checking the condition.
