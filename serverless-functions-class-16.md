# Serverless Functions

* Serverless is a cloud execution model that enables a simpler, more cost-effective way to build and operate cloud-native applications.
* Provides applications with computing resources on demand, can scale depending on the applications requirement or activity.
* Transfers all application backend cloud, patching, provisioning, scheduling, scaling etc responsiblity to the cloud provider.
* Users only charged for their usage of the resources.
* Servers exists, but the customers doesn't have to worry or manage them and they are invisible to the customer, that is why it is called serverless (from the point of the custoemr).
* All cloud service providers provide serverless service.
* Serverless includes FaaS plus all the other associated resources and cloud services and resources supporting the code - e.g. storage, databases, networks, API gateways, authentication - for which configuration, management and billing of services are invisible to the user.

## Serverless pros and cons
* ### Pros
    * Serverless enables developers focus on code and front-end not infrastructure.
    * Pay only for used resources.
    * Programmers can code in any language.
    * Simplifies and speeds up deployment because developers don't have to think about backend resources.
    * 
* ## Cons
    * Cost is not predictable in some cases so traditional servers might be a better option.
    * There might be some latency for time critical applications such as stocks prices.
    * Hard to monitor and debug using existing tools.
