# Text editors:

Text editors are tools that programming use to build programs. There are many text editors.
Some text editors are better suited to specific programming language than others. Because some were
designed to make the syntax of some language easier and handle and give helpful tips in additional to
making codes look beautiful and colorful. Even though some text editors are better than others for specific 
language, each programmer has their own preference on what text editor to use and what setup and extensions
to add to their text editor.  So we are going to use Visual Studio Code editor in this course because we are 
students and this way our instructors and TAs can easily assist us because we all using the same tool. So in some cases
it helps to use the same too because no one knows all the features of all the text editors out there.

# Command Line:
Command Line is another tool that programmers use. The idea is to use text based commands rather than graphical 
interface that we usually click/double click. Computers faster with command line commands and it is also faster
for the programmer to achieve tasks like manipulating and navigating the system.  We can create files, change directoris (cd), 
check current directory (pwd), delete or move (files/director. Also, sometimes we only have access to command line to manipulate
specific machine so as programmers we must learn and be comfortable with using command line.
