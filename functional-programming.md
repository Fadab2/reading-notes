## Functional Programming

1. What is functional programming?

   - Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
   - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
   - It does not cause any observable side effects
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

    - Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
    - Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
4. What is immutability?
    - Cannot be changed
5. What is Referential transparency?
   - same output for same input

1. What is a module?
   - a javaScript file
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
   - used to import modules 
3. How do we bring another module into the file that we are working in?
   -  we set the require() to a variable that was exported from the module
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
   -  export it
