### Whiteboard Interview

* Whiteboard interviewing is asking candidates to solve coding questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview
before starting to code/whiteboard:
* Communicate: etc restate the question, ask about edge cases and more questions about things input/output, constraints before you start whiteboarding.
* Ask about test cases
* Do your pseudocode and ask for feedback before you writing actual code.
* If pseudocode is good you can achieve some points even if you having difficulty completing the actual code.
* Conver your pseudocode to actual code and ask for feedback.
* If you can't remember some syntax it is good idea to ask your interview about it.
* If you stuck ask for help. etc “I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
* Try to have as much information before the interview through HR or your point of contact.
