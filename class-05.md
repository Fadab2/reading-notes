## HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

### HTML Images

### Adding images:
Images are important part of any webpage. Things like logos, photos and diagrams are added as an image in HTML.
We add an image using the 
 `<<img src="link to the image" alt="text to describe the image" width="width of the imag" height="height of the imag">>`
 Inside the image tag we specify the below attribute inside the img tag:
 - The address of the image `<src>`
 - Text description of the image `<alt>`
 - Title of the image  `<title>` which is a text describing the image when the image is not visible.
Choosing the right format
Optimizing images for the web
- Give the image a width/height/ using the `<width>` and `<height>` repectively.

### CSS Color
Colors give websites beautiful customized look and mages everywebsite look unique by changing the `background-color`, the the text `color` etc.

CSS uses the color property along with different ways to present the colors such as `RGB`, `HEX` and color names `black, white, blue` etc

### CSS Text

CSS allows us to change the size of the text using the `font-size:`, the typeface of the text using the `font-family:` and selecting `Georgia, Times, Arial, Times New Roman` for example to modify the text.
