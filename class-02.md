# Basics of HTML, CSS, & JS

## Basics of HTML

### Headings and paragraphs

### Bold, italic, emphasis

### Structural and semantic markup

Structural markup are elements such as `<h1>` to `<h6>` describing the size of text from biggest to smallest, `<p>` which tells the browser whatever comes inside here is a paragraph. `<footer>` that we use to tell the browser about headings and footers etc. While semantic markup are used to give some special meaning to the text/word by using elemements `<strong>` which makes a text bold, and `<em>` for making a text italic etc.

## Basics of CSS

CSS is a styling language to give our website better look gives us better control over elements of the HTML structure.

CSS has a selector and a declaration:
A selector used to select an elements that we want to affect its display on some way. And declaration is what is the exact feature or style we want to apply to the element. 
for example change the color of `<h1>` we use h1 {
    color: blue;
} the declaration must be placed inside curly brackets.

## Basics of JavaScript

Some of the JS fundementals includes functions which are used to group tasks and make them resuable and make our code cleaner. We first have to declare a function before using it. we use the keyword function followed by a function name paraenthesis and put parameters inside the paranthesis if we have them. Example:
to declare a function that calculates the total we can use:
Function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1+num2;
}
